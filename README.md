# CUHK Thesis Template
This is an MPhil/PhD thesis template for CUHK students. Use at one's own risk.

## Usage
Upload all files to some tex editor (I recommend Overleaf, an online tex editor) and compile the main file ```thesis.tex```. Edit your abstract, acknowledgement, appendix, dedication, manuscript, bibiography in ```abstract.tex```, ```acknowledgement.tex```, ```appendix.tex```, ```dedication.tex```, ```manuscript.tex```, ```mybib.bib```, respectively. Personal configurations (user-defined commands, etc.) are placed in ```config.tex```, and reference style file is stored in ```asa.bst```.

## Poster 
Edit the file ```abstract-TAS1.tex``` to generate a poster for your thesis defense.
